# Coarse-to-fine-face-normal
This repository contains an implementation for the paper "Coarse-to-Fine Face Normal Estimation".

The paper propose a coarse-to-fine framework that can effectively predict normals from face images in-the-wild. More concretely, we first build a model using limited training data to obtain a coarse (low-quality) normal map of a real face image.
